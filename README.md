This was a collaborative project made by 4 members Executed in 5 days. We worked on Travelocity Clone website. Which is an online travel agency owned by Expedia Group. We added functionality like Signup, Login, Search Hotels & Cars, add to cart, and Payment Gateway. We used React, Redux, JavaScript, CSS, and Material UI to build this website.
